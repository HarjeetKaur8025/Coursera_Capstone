    "Washington, DC, the U.S. capital, is a compact city on the Potomac River, bordering the states of Maryland and Virginia. It’s defined by imposing neoclassical monuments and buildings – including the iconic ones that house the federal government’s 3 branches: the Capitol, White House and Supreme Court. It's also home to iconic museums and performing-arts venues such as the Kennedy Center. It also have US Border Patrol and U.S. Customs & Border Protection"

Due to extreme busy and fast pace atmostphere in District of Columbia, there is always a need for cafe/coffee shops/restuarants or Sandwich Place to meet the need for thousands of visitors along with its locals every day."

    "For this Project, I imported all the libraries and packages (numpy, panda, types, geocoder, matplotlib, folium, K-means, lxml, html5lib, bs4 )required for python coding in the Jupyter Notebook.  I took the data from 'https://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/neighborhood-labels/data'. Wherein, I received the dataframe with an index and 8 columns (X,Y,OBJECTID,GIS_ID,NAME,WEB_URL,LABEL_NAME,DATELASTMODIFIED). Data Wrangling was performed to drop unneccasry columns. Since we are exploring, segmenting and clustering neighborhood so we only needed neighborhood name , their latitude and longtitude value and I used drop function to remove all the other columns mentioned above.  Then I renamed the columns 'X' and 'Y' as 'Latitude' and 'Longitude' and name as 'Neighborhood'. I proceeded with rearrange the columns in their order As Neighborhood Latitude and Longitude to perform analysis.  I checked the dataframe data, its types using dtype function and its shape  using shape().  Followed upon that I looked for statistical values of the dataframe using info function with the original dataframe.   "

Foursquare API is being used to further processing with segmentation. In the Methodology section I would share how I worked on segmentation (Explore Neighborhoods, Analyze Neighborhoods, Examine Neighborhoods) and clustering (Cluster Neighborhood)."
